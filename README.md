# Vaulted Runs

## About
Vaulted Runs is a personal web project currently in development for the online looter-shooter game Warframe. 

The website provides Warframe players interested in cracking vaulted relics several services to aid in their adventure for platinum riches by allowing them to find players quickly, protect them against known scammers, and develop relationships within the vaulted relic cracking community.

## Project Purpose
The focus of this project is to become more experienced with full stack web development (with a focus on the Django Web framework) as I pursue a career in backend web development. The aim is to see the project through to the end to grow as a developer and produce a well-polished and robust web service worth going live. There is a feeling of unease that drives you toward scrupulous development efforts knowing potentially many users other than yourself will use the services under development. This is a much different experience than developing something for yourself, a small course project, or a small script for a friend. The stakes and social ties promote positive efforts to fulfill expectations such as great services and UX for users or well designed, tested, and readable code for backend developers. Each endeavor within the project providing valuable knowledge and experience that can be directly translated to web development roles on the job.
